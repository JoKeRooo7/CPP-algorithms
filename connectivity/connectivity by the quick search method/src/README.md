## Solving the connectivity problem by the quick search method

## main_algoritm.cpp

This program reads from the standard input a sequence of pairs of non-negative integers less than <b>N</b> and maximum <b>NMAX</b>. Interpreting enter p and q as a command to link an object and outputs a linked pair

## main.cpp

My algorithm improvement. Accepts the first input of the maximum number of numbers <b>N</b>, no more than <b>MAX</b>. Creates <b>N</b> numbers and writes random values from 0 to 100. Outputs them under the index from 1 to <b>N</b> inclusive. Then, by choosing an index, he connects two numbers, remembers them. After entering 0 or a number less than 0, it stops the program for links and displays a list of all links that were created (Without repeating).
